# DubSwap
DubSwap is an internal college applicaton(this can change) with two objectives :
* Help college students rent textbooks(and potentially some other stuff) to each other at good(low) prices.
> An example scenario : A student realized that he was forced to buy a textbook for some class because he had no luck online. He has two options, either he can sell the texbook back to the book-store, or he can rent out his textbook to a student every  quarter for $50, potentially making significant money off of textbooks by the time she graduates.
* Help UW students meet strangers by preparing a conversation environment based on a specific conversation topic (small talk is deadly).
> An example scenario : A student wants to talk about Operating Systems on a Friday evening with other people. So, she will place a pin on the map to indicate her location and tag her pin with the topic "Wanna talk about Operating Systems or why Windows sucks or doesn't ?". She can also indicate when she will leave the location. Dubswap is supposed to be 
 internal to a particular college community, so sharing location is supposed to be safe !!!?

## Why Contribute ? ##
* Have fun building a real-time web-application with lots of moving parts.
* Get a sense of how network programming (we deal with sockets :D) for the web tastes, feels, and looks. 
* Since dubswap is supposed to be internal, you will get exerience with making web-comminication secure (We will prevent rainbow attacks, SQL injection, etc).
* Deliver something that could potentially be very useful.
* Get familiar with the software development regime : Testing, Git, Linting, etc ...
* The project is in its early stages, so it should be easy to jump in with my help, and hopefully I have written clean code.

## Case for the book trading feature ##
College communities are different than other communities. People in college form a network that is densely connected, and college students work in close proximities. Hence, a delivery system should not be necessary for a trading market involving college students, making it easier to reduce prices of goods for everyone's benefit. Also, since college students tend to be *well behaved*, there is a low chance of getting cheated by another college student during a trade.
