# DubSwap

DubSwap has two main objectives
* Help college students rent textbooks(and potentially some other stuff) to each other at good(low) prices. 
* Help college students get into their facorite classes even after the classes are full. 

College communities are different than other communities. People in college form a network that is densely connected, and college
students work in close proximities. Because college students are on campus while they work, it is not hard for them to meet and trade goods.
Hence, a delivery system should not be necessary for a renting market involving college students, making it easier
to reduce prices of goods for everyone's benefit.
DubSwap will primarily focus on the renting of textbooks and exchanging class because textbooks are crazy expensive here in
UW and classes become tightly packed very fast very soon.


Also, since college students tend to be *well behaved*, there is a low chance of getting cheated by another college student during a trade.
This is good because security is a major issue in markets where you rent goods that isn't real Estate.   

A succesfull *swap* has three parts 
* Traders find each other on Dubswap 
* Traders communicate with each other on Dubswap
* Traders meet at a location(usually on campus) to trade goods(classes, rent books).
