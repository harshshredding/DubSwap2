# DubSwap

DubSwap has two main objectives
* Help college students rent textbooks(and potentially some other stuff) to each other at good(low) prices. 
* Help college students get into their facorite classes even after the classes are full. 

College communities are different that other communities. People in college form a network that is densely connected, and college
students work in close proximities. Because college students are on campus while they work, it is not hard for them to meet and trade goods.
Since college students tend to be *well behaved*, there is a low chance of getting cheated by another college student during trade.
Moreover, the nature of the college network makes it more suitable for the kind of renting facility DubSwap is trying to achieve. 

A succesfull *swap* has three parts 
* Traders find each other on Dubswap 
* Traders communicate with each other on Dubswap
* Traders meet at a location( usually a campus location) to trade goods(classes, rent books).
